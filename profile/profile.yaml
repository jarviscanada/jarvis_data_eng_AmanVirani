# Introduce yourself, your academic and professional background.
# What excites you about the software industry and your passion. At least 80 words
summary: I have a Bachelor's degree in computer application from Uka Tarsadia University. For my further studies I studied web design and development in Conestoga College, and I intend to venture into software development and data engineering. I am centered around problem-solving, and being able to construct solutions that are extendable, scalable, and maintainable. In terms of academics, I have studied operating systems, algorithms, computability, web development, parallel programming, and much more. As for work experience, I currently work at Jarvis as a data engineer, where I work on projects that involve constructing some pipelines to deliver data in a format that would allow for further analysis. Altogether, they make up all the skills and experience that I want to carry forward towards new opportunities. It will make use of my abilities and allow me to further learn new technologies. I am passionate about this journey that I'm on, and I can't wait to see what's up ahead.

    description:  Implemented a monitoring agent that keeps track of the hardware specifications and usage throughout time of host machines and store their data in a database. The monitoring agent is programmed using Bash, and PostgresSQL is used as a database, which would run in a Docker container. Testing was all done on a CentOS 7 virtual machine running on the Google Cloud Platform. Every script was tested manually to ensure that they all run successfully according to their specifications.

    description:
      - "**Twitter App**: Developed a Twitter application, which was used to explore Twitter's REST API capabilities. The application was designed to allow users to post, show, and delete tweets in Twitter from the app's CLI. The application was programmed in Java and utilizes an HTTP client to run the HTTP requests made when an operation is executed for authentication. Maven was used to build the project and manage all the class dependencies in the package. The Spring framework was used in the app to simplify dependency management. JUnit4 and Mockito were used to test the app and Docker was used to containerize the project and push it to Docker Hub to allow it to run on any computer system."
      - "**JDBC App**: This app is used for CRUD process for a RDBMS database in a PSQL instance. The implementation uses JDBC to connect to the database, customer DAO(Data Access Object) to handle CRUD process, Dbeaver is used to generate ER Diagram, docker container to contain the PSQL instance."
      - "**Grep App**: Implemented a grep app in Java. This app searches for a text pattern recursively in a given directory, and store the matched lines to a file. Use slf4j library for log, and regex library to search the pattern. Re-implemented the methods that return a list of all files in a given directory and a list of all strings in a file using Lambda and Stream APIs. Dockerize the grep app by docker and push the image to Docker Hub for easier distribution."

    description: Developed a user-friendly movie streaming web application. Using Firebase to store the data in database. ReactJS and Redux were used to code the application. Used TMDI API to fetch the movies and TV shows. Stripe was used as payment for subscription. Management of project done through Agile development techniques using Trello.
  - name: "Room Rental Android System"
    description: For most people, house hunting feels like an extreme sport. You look at, what feels like, a million different homes only to pick them all apart without finding the one. Created a Splash Activity highlighting the logo and Recycler View to list the products from SQLite in a CardView. Used Fragments to display the product information. The basic operations include Register/Login and storing in firebase real-time database. The main operation includes Adding Room Post, Favourite Post and maintaining the images and data through the real-time database.
  - name: "Finding Homes - CORE Php and phpMyAdmin"
    description: if you're wondering how long it takes to buy a house, the answer is it depends. On average, a homebuyer can spend a few days to go through the initial pre-approval process, anywhere from a few weeks to a few months shopping for the right home, and 30 to 45 days to close the deal. Finding Homes makes it a lot easier for you. AJAX, jQuery, JavaScript also used in the Front-End.
